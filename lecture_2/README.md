# Janelia ML Course - lecture 2

## Exercises and milestones for lab 2

### Intro Python and programming
1. Have Anaconda (conda) installed
2. Make sure scikit.learn is installed
3. Install statsmodels
	`pip install statsmodels`
4. Open and run the Lecture_2.ipynb notebook

### Exercises
1. Decode hand position from neural activity using a linear decoder
2. Find the 10 best neurons for decoding hand position
3. Build the best possible nonlinear decoder
4. Build an encoding model for neuron 0 to predict neural activity from hand position and velocity using a linear-nonlinear-Poisson GLM
